# üìÅ Identity Management and Access Control System

## üîí Project Description

This system provides **secure identity management** and **precise access control** to resources. Its main functionality is **creating folders** where users can store their files.

Access to these folders is strictly controlled through **assigned permissions**, allowing the system to define exactly **who can access resources and how**. For example:
- User A may have full access to a folder,
- User B may have read-only access,
- User C may be completely restricted.

The system offers flexible access management, making it an ideal solution for **teams and organizations** that need to **protect their data** and assign permissions based on specific requirements.
